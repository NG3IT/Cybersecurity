## Recover AD credentials

[Breached AD](https://tryhackme.com/room/breachingad)

Some techniques :
- NTML Authenticated services
- LDAP bind credentials
- Authentication relays
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
- Configuration files

Two popular methods for gainging access to that first set of AD credentials is **OSINT** and **phishing**

#### OSINT 

- Stack Overflow : sometimes user who asked disclose sensitive information
- GitHub : scripts with credentials hardcoded
- Credentials being disclosed : [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) / [Haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

#### Phishing

### NTLM / NetNTLM

NTML : New Technology LAN Manager is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users' identity in AD

NetNTLM : Authentication by using a chellenge-response based cheme called NetNTLM

Example of services who use NTLM :
- Internally-hosted mail server that expose an Outlook Web App
- RDP exposed to the internet
- VPN integrated with AD
- Web applications internet facing and make use of NetNTLM

## Procedure

Enumerate global information :

```bash
$ enum4linux <IP>
```

Enumérate user :

```bash
$ ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --domain THM-AD --dc 10.10.171.193 /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt 
```

Abusing Kerberos (GetNPUsers.py) :

```bash
$ impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py <ip>/<user>
```
