## Discovery of hosts alive (Layer2/Layer3) :

---

### Layer 2

Arp scan (without port scan)
```bash
sudo nmap -PR -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

ICMP request scan (without port scan)
```bash
sudo nmap -PE -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

---

### Layer 3

Timestamp ICMP scan (without port scan)
```bash
sudo nmap -PP -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

Netmask ICMP request scan (without port scan)
```bash
sudo nmap -PM -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

Arp-scan tool (local network) 
```bash
arp-scan -I <interface> -l
```

---

### Layer 4

TCP SYN ping
```bash
sudo nmap -PS<port_numer> -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

---

TCP ACK ping 
```bash
sudo nmap -PA<port_numer> -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

UDP ping 
```bash
sudo nmap -PU<port_numer> -sn <target>/<cidr>
```

---

## Simple scan

Treat all hosts as online (skip host discovery)
```bash
nmap -Pn <target>
```

---

## Nmap six states result :

1. Open : Service is listening.
2. Closed : No service is listening.
3. Filtered : Port can be open or closed because is not accessible. Probably cause by FW.
4. Unfiltered :  Port is available. Often met when it is a ACK scan (-sA switch).
5. Open|Filtered : Nmap can't determine if port is open or filtered
6. Cload|Filtered : Nmap can't determine if port is closed or filtered

---

## TCP Connect Scan

SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK and RST/ACK (will reset the connection after complete a 3 handshake TCP)

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sT <IP>
```

---

## TCP SYN Scan

SYN -> SYN/ACK -> RST (will not complete a 3 handshake TCP. That result to less chance that scan to be logged)

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sS <IP>
```

---

## The following scans (NULL/FIN/XMAS) are useful when there is a stateless FW in front of the target.

---

## Null Scan

Null (no flag set)

The target responds if the port is closed with a RST packet.

Null -> ACK/RST

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sN <IP>
```

---

## FIN Scan

FIN -> no response if port is probably opened or if a FW dropped the packet

The target will returns RST/ACK if the port is closed.

FIN -> RST/ACK 

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sF <IP>
```

---

## Xmas Scan

This scan sends to the target FIN, PSH and URG flags simultaneously.

FIN,PUSH,URG -> no response if port is probably opened or if a FW dropped the packet

The target will returns RST/ACK if the port is closed.

FIN,PUSH,URG -> RST/ACK 

---

## TCP ACK Scan

Useful when there is a FW in front of the target. This scan can be useful for help us to discover the FW rules and configuration.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sA <IP>
```

---

## Windows Scan

Useful when there is a FW in front of the Windows target. This scan can be useful for help us to discover the FW rules and configuration.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sW <IP>
```

---

## UDP Scan

Just UDP packets send. 

UDP Packet -> ICMP Type 3, Code 3 (will generated an ICMP packet destination unreachable for every closed port)

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sU <IP>
```

---

## Scan Timing

1. paranoid (0) -> use for avoid IDS alertes
2. sneaky(1) -> use for avoid IDS alertes
3. polite (2)
4. normal (3)
5. aggressive (4)
6. insane (5)

```bash
--max-rate <number>
```

THe --max-rate switch can set to specify a maximum packets sent per second. (example -> --max-rate 10)

---

## IP/MAN Spoofing Scan

IP spoofing scan is interesting when you can capture the traffic network.

```bash
$ nmap -e <network_interface> -Pn -S <spoofed_IP> <IP>
```

It's the same story for a MAC spoofing scan.

```bash
$ nmap --spoof-man <spoofed_mac> -Pn -S <spoofed_IP> <IP>
```

---

## Decoy scan

This scan will be helpful when you make a IP/MAC spoofing scan and you want to dispatch the target machine answers.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -D <decoy_ip_1>,<decoy_ip_2>,...,ME <IP>
```

---

## Fragmented packets

By default, switch -f will divided packet into 8 bytes or less.

-f -> 8 bytes 

-ff -> 16 bytes

It is possible to change this division value with --mtu switch (take a of multiple of 8)

---

## IDLE/Zombie Scan

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sI <zombie_ip> <IP>
```
